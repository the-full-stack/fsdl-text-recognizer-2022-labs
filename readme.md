# 🥞 Full Stack Deep Learning Fall 2022 Labs

Welcome!

As part of Full Stack Deep Learning 2022, we will incrementally develop a complete deep learning codebase to create and deploy a model that understands the content of hand-written paragraphs.

We will use the modern stack of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/).

We will use the main workhorses of DL today: CNNs and Transformers.

We will manage our experiments using what we believe to be the best tool for the job: [Weights & Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/).

We will set up a quality assurance and continuous integration system for our codebase using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

We will package up the prediction system as a REST API and deploy it as a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) container on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

We will wrap that prediction system in a frontend written in Python using [Gradio](https://gradio.app/docs).

We will set up monitoring that alerts us to potential issues in our model using [Gantry](https://gantry.io/).
